bdwalk:
  You're given a top-down view of a building of unknown height. Grey cells represent elevators.

  1. Draw a path from S to G that doesn't branch off or overlap itself at any cell.

  2. The path must visit every number and elevator.

  3. The path goes up one or more floors at an Up arrow, and goes down one or more floors at a Down arrow.

  4. The path must change floors at an elevator without an arrow, but this can be in either direction.

  5. A number indicates the floor that the path should be on when passing through it.

  6. At no point does the path go below the 1st floor.

  This genre first appeared in Puzzle Communication Nikoli vol. 174.


canal:
  Shade some cells on the board.

  1. The number on a cell indicates how many cells are shaded in a continuous line starting from the cell. These lines are in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

  2. You cannot shade a cell with a number.
  
  3. The shaded cells cannot form a 2x2 square.
  
  4. All shaded cells form an orthogonally contiguous area.

  This genre is invented by Prasanna Seshadri.


cbanana:
  Shade some cells on the board.

  1. A group of shaded cells must form a rectangle or square.

  2. A group of unshaded cells must not form a rectangle or square.

  3. A number indicates the size of the (shaded or unshaded) group that overlaps it. A group can contain one or more numbers, or none at all.

  This genre first appeared in Puzzle Communication Nikoli vol. 176.


chainedb:
  Shade some cells on the board to form blocks of any shape.

  1. Each block must contain exactly one number or a question mark.

  2. A number indicates the size of the block that contains it.

  3. Diagonally adjacent blocks form a chain. A chain cannot contain two identically shaped blocks, counting rotations and reflections as the same.

  4. All blocks must be diagonally adjacent to at least one other block.


crossstitch:
  Draw diagonal lines to make two loops.

  1. A shaded cell is not part of any loop.

  2. Loops cannot branch off or cross themselves, but they can cross each other.

  3. Two cells where the loops intersect cannot be horizontally or vertically adjacent.

  4. A circled number indicates how many of that cell's corner points touch a loop.

  5. A number with an arrow indicates how many cells in that direction contain an intersection, up to the next shaded cell.

  6. A question mark can be replaced with any number except 0.

  This genre is invented by Arvi Teikari a.k.a. Hempuli.


dotchi:
  Draw lines through orthogonally adjacent cells to form a loop.

  1. The loop cannot branch off or cross itself.

  2. The loop goes through all unshaded circles.

  3. Within a region, all unshaded circles contain either a corner or a straight line.

  4. The loop cannot go through a shaded circle.


lohkous:
  Draw lines over the dotted lines to divide the board into several blocks.

  1. Each block must contain exactly one square with one or more numbers on it.

  2. All lines must be used to divide two regions, there can not be any dead-ends.

  3. When dividing a block into horizontal segments, each segment must have a length specified by one of the clue numbers. The same applies when dividing the block into vertical segments.

  4. Each number must be represented at least once by a horizontal or vertical segment in the same block.

  5. A question mark can replace any number, as long as no number is repeated in that cell.

  This genre is invented by Arvi Teikari a.k.a. Hempuli.


ovotovata:
  Draw lines through orthogonally adjacent cells to form a loop.

  1. When the loop exits a numbered region in any direction, it must travel in a straight line for the indicated number of cells, and then turn. e.g. A number 1 means that the loop must turn immediately after leaving that region.

  2. A question mark can be replaced with any number.

  3. All shaded regions must be visited at least once.

  This genre is invented by Eric Fox.


voxas:
  Draw lines over the dotted lines to divide the board into several areas. Some lines are given.
  
  1. All areas must be rectangular in shape, and must be 2 or 3 cells in size.

  2. Two rectangles divided by a white circle must have the same size and orientation.

  3. Two rectangles divided by a grey circle must have the same size or the same orientation, but not both.

  4. Two rectangles divided by a black circles must have different size and different orientation.

  This genre is invented by Eric Fox.
